# Devices
My first project on github
In this project I tried to make an assistant, which can control your house's devices.
In my opinion, the only think I can add to make this project ideal is GUI. At the moment I can create only simple GUI using Swing or JavaFX.
In the future I'm going to add GUI to this project, so that it looks great.
Thanks for attention! Good luck!
